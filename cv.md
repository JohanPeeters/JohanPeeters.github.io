Born in Ukkel, Belgium on June 11, 1958

Married to Caroline Greenman since 1981

2 sons: Yan (1983) and Samuel (1986)

I am a software architect with broad knowledge and experience. 
Analytical by nature, I greatly value creativity.
I enjoy finding pragmatic solutions to business requirements. 
While I continue being fascinated by nuts and bolts, I believe that good design serves people, not technology.
My expertise ranges from product definition to development.
I have helped major corporations such as <a href="http://www.nbb.be" target="new">NBB/BNB</a> (the Belgian central bank), <a href="http://www.philips.com" target="new">Philips</a>, <a href="http://www.proximus.be" target="new">Proximus</a>, <a href="http://www.post.be/" target="new">bpost</a>, <a href="http://www.vrt.be" target="new">VRT</a> and <a href="https://www.colruytgroup.com" target="new">Colruyt</a> as well as SME's.
