Born in Ukkel, Belgium on June 11, 1958

Married to Caroline Greenman since 1981

2 sons: Yan (1983) and Samuel (1986)

I am a software architect with broad knowledge and experience. 
Analytical by nature, I greatly value creativity.
I enjoy finding pragmatic solutions to business requirements. 
While I continue being fascinated by nuts and bolts, I believe that good design serves people, not technology.
