<p>
Proximus' prepaid cards are implemented on the Alcatel Open Services Platform.
The platform is a service oriented architecture and runs on a cluster of Tru64 alpha nodes.
</p>
<p>
New capabilities were added to allow more innovative pricing schemes.
I designed and executed the acceptance tests.
I used <a href="http://www.mercury.com" target="_blank">Mercury</a> TestDirector for
<ul>
	<li>
		gathering test requirements,
	</li>
	<li>
		designing tests,
	</li>
	<li>
		drawing up a test plan,
	</li>
	<li>
		scheduling and guiding test execution,
	</li>
	<li>
		managing defects.
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Although the test campaigns were focused on functional increments, they contributed to an overall improvement of the service quality by adopting a more rigorous test approach than had hitherto been the case and by improving the delivery and defect follow-up procedures.
</p>
<p>
I wrote a Ruby script to check the accounting tickets for anomalies. 
The script has proved useful both to improve test productivity and as an early warning system in the production environment.
</p>
<p>
I developed an end-to-end automated test chain based on <a href="http://fit.c2.com" target="_blank">FIT</a> tables.
Initially I used the FIT implementation to drive the test fixtures, but the FIT framework was subsequently replaced by a proprietary implementation of a FIT-like framework using WinRunner scripts in order to smoothly integrate call tests with TestDirector.
