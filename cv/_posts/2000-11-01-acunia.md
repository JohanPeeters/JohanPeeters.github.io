Vehicle telematics platform

Acunia provides a vehicle telematics platform, currently used principally for fleet management.
In 2000-2001, Acunia was developing
+ hardware for the in-vehicle terminal,
+ an OS for the in-vehicle terminal,
+ device drivers for terminal peripherals,
+ a VM for Java applications running on the terminal,
+ an terminal application framework, based on the OSGi specifications,
+ terminal applications,
+ a back-end for the terminal applications.
All application software and a good part of the infrastructure software was written in Java. The back-end was EJB-based  and ran on any J2EE-compliant application server and could be integrated with any RDBMS.
As senior software architect, I specified and led the development of secure messaging. The APIs were based on the JMS specification. Security services were supported by a Public Key Infrastructure implementation provided by COSIC.
