<p>
ACUNIA provides a vehicle telematics platform, currently used principally for fleet management.
In 2000-2001, ACUNIA was developing
<ul>
	<li>hardware for the in-vehicle terminal,</li>
	<li>an OS for the in-vehicle terminal,</li>
	<li>device drivers for terminal peripherals,</li>
	<li>a VM for Java applications running on the terminal,</li>
	<li>an terminal application framework, based on the OSGi specifications,</li>
	<li>terminal applications,</li>
	<li>a back-end for the terminal applications.</li>
</ul>
All application software and a good part of the infrastructure software was written in Java. The back-end was EJB-based  and ran on any J2EE-compliant application server and could be integrated with any RDBMS.
As senior software architect, I specified and led the development of secure messaging. The APIs were based on the JMS specification. Security services were supported by a Public Key Infrastructure implementation provided by COSIC.
