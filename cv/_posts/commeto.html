<p>
In this assignment, the ground was laid for COMmeto's consumer appliance providing gateway services between IP and home automation networks.
</p>
<p>
The wide-ranging study looked for existing technologies to leverage in this niche market.
IP enabled devices such as desktop PCs, PDAs and high-end audio-visual remote control devices connect to the gateway's HTTP server.
Depending on the client's capabilities, a control application is then started on the client as an applet or in the web server.
The web server runs a Java servlet container.
</p>
<p>
Other technologies that were studied extensively with a view to integration in the gateway included
<ul>
	<li>LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) for home automation directory services,</li>
	<li>JMX (Java Management Extension) for manageability of home automation devices, and its drivers, that can join and leave the home network dynamically,</li>
	<li>OSGi (Open Service Gateway initiative) for life cycle management of home automation services and their mutual isolation.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Particular attention was paid to the following security issues:
<ul>
	<li>Making the COMmeto gateway impervious to reverse engineering attacks.</li>
	<li>Controlling home devices across the hostile public Internet while avoiding spoofing attacks.</li>
</ul>
