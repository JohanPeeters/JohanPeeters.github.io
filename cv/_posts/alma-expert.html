<p>
ALMA-Expert was an expert system for network management. 
</p>
<p>
I was responsible for developing SNMP-Expert, an ALMA-Expert knowledge base and set of plug-ins to manage TCP/IP networks. 
I also provided a high-availability architecture based on Qualix (later Veritas) clustering software. In order to allow ALMA-Expert to be deployed in clusters, daemons had to be extended with an interface responding to status requests. I also provided the Bourne Shell scripts which are called by the clustering software to monitor and control daemon processes.
