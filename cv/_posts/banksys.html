<p>
Banksys manufactures Point of Sales (PoS) terminals that are both used in their own network and sold to third parties.
Terminals have two processors.
One is the security processor, the other runs appplications on embedded Linux.
Applications can be written in a number of languages, including Java.
In this assignment, I was involved in a team effort to design architectural features including
<ul>
	<li>infrastructure services,</li>
	<li>the language-independent programming model, e.g. the service calling discipline,</li>
	<li>communication between applications.</li>
</ul>
My specific responsibility included
<ul>
	<li>design of a Java API to the infrastructure,</li>
	<li>the Java programming model,</li>
	<li>a development tool chain.</li>
</ul>
The latter was based on the J9 virtual machine and the WebSphere Device Developer (WSDD) plugin for Eclipse.
A proof of concept implementation demonstrated the soundness of the architecture and APIs.
