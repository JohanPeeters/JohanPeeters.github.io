iPronto was launched in February 2003 in the U.S. market. Its launch in Europe took place in the summer of the same year. This is in many respects a very ambitious product. It is, for example, the first remote control for audio-visual equipment that has direct access to the Internet via a WiFi, or wireless LAN, interface. This not only allows users to browse the Internet on an embedded web browser, but also enables networked applications. 
The prime example of this is the Electronic Program Guide, an application that I also worked on in a <a href="http://johanpeeters.com/cv/tech/philips-ws.html">previous assignment</a>.
Moreover, the software stack running on iPronto was built to provide dynamic download and installation capabilities.
It comprises 
<ul>
	<li>an embedded Linux OS,</li>
	<li>a Java VM running the PersonalJava profile,</li>
	<li>an OSGi framework.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Being a very innovative product, iPronto required a major overhaul by the last quarter of 2003 as unanticipated problems emerged from the user community. I was commisioned to analyse the perceived defects and propose an improvement program. Above and beyond addressing the significant technical issues, this also involved marketing, product and project management and budgeting. The improvement program's project plan included
<ul>
	<li>descriptions of the principal problems,</li>
	<li>strategies for solving them,</li>
	<li>effort estimates,</li>
	<li>business priorities,</li>
	<li>benchmarks for the problematic features,</li>
	<li>high-level test descriptions.</li>
</ul>
In a later phase of the project, I focused on one of the technical issues; 
I redesigned and re-implemented TCP/IP and WiFi configuration, from User Interface to network card.
</p>
<p>
The new firmware was released at the beginning of 2004 and was well received by the user community.
