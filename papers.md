I have given presentations and led workshops at several conferences, including [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org), [XPDays Benelux](http://www.xpday.net) and BCS [Software Practice Advancement conference](http://www.spaconference.org) (SPA) on software architecture, security and performance engineering.

 Here are some of my papers on which may be of interest. I have thought deeply about fulfilling Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) in an agile development process. Security is the non-functional I am most interested in, which led me to present a position paper on [Agile Security Requirements Engineering](/papers/abuser stories.pdf) to the Symposium on Requirements Engineering for Information Security at the [IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference in 2005](http://crinfo.univ-paris1.fr/RE05/) in which I coin the term *abuser stories*, an interpolation between agile's user stories and McDermott & Fox's abuse cases. Running a workshop on this topic at SPA in 2006, I met [Paul Dyson](https://twitter.com/pauldyson) - our discussion on NFRs led to follow-up workshops at XP Days Benelux in 2006 and SP in 2007. We also wrote a column on [Cost-Effective Security](/papers/cost-effective security.pdf) for the May/June issue of [IEEE Security & Privacy](https://www.computer.org/security-and-privacy/) magazine. You may also be interested in [Quality in Agile Software Development](/papers/Quality Requirements Handout.pdf), a handout for a workshop I led with [Nelis Bouck√©](@nelisboucke) and [Alexander Helleboogh](@lexhelleboogh) comparing techniques for tracking and planning NFRs at XP Days Benelux 2011.
