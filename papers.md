I have given presentations and led workshops at several conferences, including [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org), [XPDays Benelux](http://www.xpday.net) and BCS [Software Practice Advancement conference](http://www.spaconference.org) (SPA) on software architecture, security and performance engineering.

Here are some of my papers and presentations which may be of interest.
### Agile development and security ###

Everyone claims to be agile these days, but how is that reconciled with meeting Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)? Security is the non-functional I am most interested in, which led me to present a position paper on [Agile Security Requirements Engineering](/papers/abuser stories.pdf) to the Symposium on Requirements Engineering for Information Security at the [IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference in 2005](http://crinfo.univ-paris1.fr/RE05/) in which I coin the term *abuser stories*, an interpolation between agile's user stories and McDermott & Fox's abuse cases. Running a workshop on this topic at SPA in 2006, I met [Paul Dyson](https://twitter.com/pauldyson) - our discussion on NFRs led to follow-up workshops at XP Days Benelux in 2006 and SPA in 2007. We also wrote a column on [Cost-Effective Security](/papers/cost-effective security.pdf) for the May/June issue of [IEEE Security & Privacy](https://www.computer.org/security-and-privacy/) magazine. You may also be interested in [Quality in Agile Software Development](/papers/Quality Requirements Handout.pdf), a handout for a workshop I led with [Nelis Boucké](https://twitter.com/nelisboucke) and [Alexander Helleboogh](https://twitter.com/lexhelleboogh) comparing techniques for tracking and planning NFRs at XP Days Benelux 2011.

### Access control for REST services ###

Making sense of the standards and products used for protecting REST services is challenging. [A video of me explaining current practices and pitfalls](https://youtu.be/PrCxuXOdDQc) at [SecAppDev](https://www.secappdev.org/) 2017 is available on YouTube. There is plenty of discussion with the off-camera audience, particularly [Jim Manico](https://twitter.com/manicode). I learned from this lecture that this topic needs to be discussed interactively and demo-ed, so at SPA 2017, I led [a workshop on the same topic]( https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DmVlveGKba0KNki_U-2cbLmBQQxcYHvvqW4lcmWa7xM/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) together with [Michael Boeynaems](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelboeynaems).

### TLS ###

TLS may not be perfect, but it is a very convenient way of protecting communication and should be used more widely. I have helped clients in consultancy engagements to do so and advocated its correct use in a number of public fora, including OWASP conferences, SecAppDev courses and, most recently, [SPA 2017 together with Nelis Boucké](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11t_CYwxUcBlbBrVqlu7tDuJTS71ywtt7GJ2JkyGsy1M/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).
