You can hire me as a development contractor, both at clients' sites on a time-and-materials basis, and outsourced under fixed-price/fixed-term conditions.

I also provide technical coaching and you can call on me for architecture and code review.

Together with [archiwise](http://archiwise.com), I run the [Softwarewolves](http://softwarewolves.net) coding contest. This is an ideal one-day team-building activity for code-centric environments.

My special fields of interest are software security, performance engineering, test-driven development, continuous delivery and DevOps.

I feel most comfortable in the Java, JavaScript and Ruby ecosystems, but have also written substantial programs in Lisp, C, Python, COBOL and Perl. I am always keen to learn new programming languages and environments.
